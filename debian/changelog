opptimizer (1.5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed critical kernel lock bug - unlock_kernel() now called on all error paths
  * Added NULL pointer checks for omap_get_volt_data_fp() return values
  * Added NULL pointer checks for freq_table and policy before use
  * Fixed buffer overflow bug in proc_opptimizer_read() (count+ret -> count-ret)
  * Improved code comments explaining reverse engineering approach and rationale
  * Better documentation of voltage/frequency ordering and magic numbers
